# ðŸŒ€ Mess â€” My Swift Learning Repo

This repo is my personal **Swift & SwiftUI playground**.
Iâ€™ll dump everything I learn here: code snippets, experiments, cheatsheets, and messy notes.

The goal is not perfection â€” itâ€™s **growth and review**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Review Swift **core syntax** (optionals, structs vs classes, closures, enums, protocols).
- Learn **SwiftUI UI building** (views, modifiers, navigation, animations).
- Understand **data flow** (state, bindings, `@ObservedObject`, `@StateObject`, MVVM).
- Explore **collections** (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, sets, dictionaries).
- Experiment with **iOS features** (notifications, persistence, networking).
- Build small **side projects** (widgets, utilities, UI clones).

## ðŸ“– Topics to Cover

### Core Swift
- [ ] Optionals (`?` and `!`)
- [ ] Structs vs Classes
- [ ] Enums (with associated values)
- [ ] Closures + trailing closure syntax
- [ ] Protocols & Generics basics

### Collections
- [ ] Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `compactMap`)
- [ ] Dictionary (hash maps) basics
- [ ] Sets and when to use them

### SwiftUI
- [ ] Views & modifiers
- [ ] State management (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`)
- [ ] Layout system (Stacks, Grids, GeometryReader)
- [ ] Navigation (NavigationStack, NavigationLink)
- [ ] Animations & transitions

### Architecture
- [ ] MVVM basics
- [ ] ObservableObject & EnvironmentObject
- [ ] Dependency Injection with Protocols

## ðŸ§ª Experiments

Every note or code snippet here is an experiment:
- Optionals practice
- `map` / `filter` / `reduce` drills
- SwiftUI glassmorphism button
- Mini apps (like todo lists, UI clones, widgets)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This repo is my **reference library** â€” messy, but mine.
Iâ€™ll keep adding as I learn, and maybe refactor later.
